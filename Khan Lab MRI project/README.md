# Flexible MRI Coil & EKG Project – USC Khan Lab

## Overview
This research project focuses on the design and optimization of **flexible MRI coils** and an **EKG acquisition system** to improve medical imaging and patient monitoring. My role centers on developing hardware solutions that enhance **signal quality, impedance matching, and phase shifting** in MRI applications, while also supporting real-time EKG data collection.

## My Role & Contributions
- **Coil Optimization:** Designed matching networks and calculated optimal **phase shifts** for MRI coils to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  
- **Custom PCB Design:** Developed circuit schematics in **Altium Designer** for impedance matching boards and π-phase shifters, enabling precise control of MRI coil signals.  
- **EKG System Development:** Programmed an **AFE (Analog Front-End)** for EKG data acquisition using **nRF52 microcontrollers** (Segger Embedded Studio + nRF Connect SDK).  
- **Fabrication:** Printed flexible MRI coils using the Voltera PCB printer and built custom coaxial cables for integration.  
- **Testing & Validation:** Measured Q factor, impedance matching, and system reliability using NanoVNA and benchtop equipment.  

## Key Technical Details
- **Tools:** Altium Designer, Segger Embedded Studio, NanoVNA, Voltera PCB Printer  
- **Hardware:** nRF52 microcontroller, ADS1293 AFE, custom impedance matching boards, coaxial cable assemblies  
- **Concepts:** Impedance matching, phase shifting, Q factor optimization, flexible PCB design  
- **Programming:** C/C++ for embedded microcontrollers  

## Results
- Increased coil clarity by improving **Q factor measurements** and optimizing impedance matching.  
- Achieved **successful phase shifting** for MRI coil alignment, improving imaging quality.  
- Developed a working prototype of an **EKG acquisition system** integrated with custom PCB hardware.
