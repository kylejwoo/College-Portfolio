# Safe and Intelligent Autonomy Lab Drone Project – Vicon Motion Capture & ROS2 Integration

## Overview
This project focuses on real-time control of a quadrotor drone using a **Vicon motion capture system** integrated with **ROS2** for communication and control. The goal is to achieve reliable autonomous flight by combining precise positional tracking with flexible real-time software frameworks.

## My Role & Contributions
- **System Integration:** Set up communication between the **Vicon camera system** and the drone via **ROS2**, enabling real-time positional feedback.  
- **Embedded Development:** Configured the drone’s flight controller to receive external commands, optimizing responsiveness and stability during tests.  
- **Networking & Middleware:** Designed ROS2 nodes to handle Vicon data streams and ensure low-latency control signals.  
- **Testing & Validation:** Conducted controlled flight experiments to measure latency, drift, and system reliability.  

## Key Technical Details
- **Frameworks:** ROS2 (real-time communication)  
- **Motion Capture:** Vicon camera system for sub-millimeter tracking  
- **Hardware:** Custom quadrotor platform, onboard sensors, flight controller  
- **Programming Languages:** C++ and Python (ROS2 nodes)  
- **Networking:** UDP/ROS2 DDS communication for low-latency control loops  

## Results
- Established a stable closed-loop control system between the **Vicon mocap system** and drone.  
- Reduced control latency to **<30 ms**, enabling accurate trajectory tracking.  
- Successfully demonstrated autonomous hovering and trajectory following in a lab environment.  

## Skills Gained
- ROS2 development and real-time communication  
- Middleware integration for autonomous systems  
- Motion capture and sensor fusion for robotics  
- Embedded software and control system tuning
