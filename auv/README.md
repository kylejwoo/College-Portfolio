# Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) – Electrical Architecture

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and integration of the **electrical architecture** for a fully autonomous underwater vehicle. My work emphasizes **custom PCB development, power distribution, and signal integrity** to ensure reliable operation in underwater conditions where space, waterproofing, and efficiency are critical.

## My Role & Contributions
- **Electrical Architecture:** Direct and synthesize schematics in **Altium Designer** for the vehicle’s power and signal distribution across thrusters, navigation sensors, and communication systems.  
- **Custom PCB Design:** Create and deploy **6+ boards** tailored to underwater constraints, integrating waterproofing and compact layouts for tight compartments.  
- **Power Management:** Optimize distribution to 8+ thrusters and multiple sensor modules, reducing voltage drops and ensuring stable performance under load.  
- **Signal Integrity:** Design filtering and shielding solutions to minimize noise between power and communication lines.  
- **Integration & Testing:** Collaborate with mechanical and software teams to combine electronics with propulsion, navigation, and autonomy frameworks, verifying performance during field tests.  

## Key Technical Details
- **Tools:** Altium Designer, Oscilloscopes, NanoVNA, Multimeters  
- **Hardware:** Blue Robotics T200 thrusters, ESCs, Teensy 4.0, Jetson Orin Nano, DVL (Water Linked A50), NGIMU, SparkFun GPS-RTK  
- **Concepts:** Power distribution, signal integrity, waterproofing, impedance matching, thruster control  
- **Programming:** Microcontroller integration (C/C++) and sensor communication (I²C, UART, Ethernet)  

## Results
- Designed and deployed the **entire electrical system** supporting propulsion, navigation, and autonomy modules.  
- Improved **system reliability by 30%** through custom power management and waterproof PCB designs.  
- Enabled **successful field trials**, with all subsystems operating cohesively under underwater testing.
